## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to automate the implementation
of ANSSI's best practices and norms, focusing on specific chapters
that address system hardening and Linux identification/authentication.
By developing a comprehensive shell script, this project aims to
facilitate the integration of ANSSI's guidelines into Linux-based
systems in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

## Features

List the key features:

- User Selection Menu
- Parameter Input Prompts
- Confirmation Prompts
- Progress Indicators
- Error Handling and Guidance
- Logging and Reporting

## Installation

Linus OS, and shell to exercute script.

## Usage

The script presents a user-friendly menu with various choices for system hardening tasks. Users can navigate through the menu to select specific hardening measures they want to apply. Before execution, the script prompts for confirmation, ensuring that users can review their selections before proceeding.

### Example:

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./MainScriptMenu.sh
   ```
2. Make your choice from the menu:
   ```bash
